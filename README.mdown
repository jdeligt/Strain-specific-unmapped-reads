# The scrapheap challenge:
## Extracting relevant biological information, including strain-specific genomic segments, from unmapped NGS-reads.

Code for manuscript:
*       ContigSplitter.ipynb
        * Divide contigs in strain-specific and common ones
        * Input: BLAT-psl files of all-vs-all contig-alignments
        * Output: contignames of strain-specific contig
